                        <p>Solar energy is one of the fastest-growing industries in the world, as more countries and companies invest in renewable sources of power to combat climate change and reduce their dependence on fossil fuels.</p>
                        <p>According to the International Energy Agency, solar photovoltaic capacity increased by 26% in 2022, reaching 1300 terawatt hours globally. The IEA projects that solar PV will account for 22% of global power capacity by 2027.</p>
                        <p> Although higher gas and oil price spikes made solar stocks rally in 2022, as energy prices retreated in 2023, enthusiasm for renewables has temporarily dampened.</p>
                        <p>Still, investors who want to capitalize on the renewable energy trend, should begin looking now into the best solar energy stocks in the market.</p>
                        <p>Therefore, here are three solar stocks with high prospects to reap investors returns in 2024.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">What is Solar?</h2>
                        <p>Solar power is energy from the sun that is converted into thermal or electrical energy. Solar energy is the cleanest and most abundant renewable energy source available, and the U.S. has some of the richest solar resources in the world. Solar technologies can harness this energy for a variety of uses, including generating electricity, providing light or a comfortable interior environment, and heating water for domestic, commercial, or industrial use.</p>
                        <p>Businesses and industry use solar technologies to diversify their energy sources, improve efficiency, and save money. Energy developers and utilities use solar photovoltaic and concentrating solar power technologies to produce electricity on a massive scale to power cities and small towns.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Why go Solar?</h2>
                        <p> 
                            <ol>
                            <li> Lower your energy bills.
                            Did you know that rooftop solar can reduce the average household’s annual power bill by $1,500 or more? Over the years, it’s a long-term investment that can save you tens of thousands of dollars.
                            </li>
                            <li>Prepare for a rainy day.
                            Stored solar energy power doesn’t need to be used right away. In case of a literal rainy day – or a power outage – your house can still be powered by solar. All you need is to store the energy in a battery (psst, we have tax credits for that too!).
                            </li>
                            <li>Join the clean energy movement.
                            The power sources your household uses are among the greatest factors in your carbon footprint; an increase of solar power usage can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and other pollutants that contribute to climate change. In the United States, there are over 3,000 square miles of rooftops on which solar panels could be installed. Will your rooftop be part of the clean energy movement?
                            </li>
                            <li>Save more money with tax credits!
                            Through President Biden’s Investing in America agenda, the federal tax credit for solar was increased. Now, eligible consumers can save 30% on the original installation cost of a solar photovoltaic system. To apply for this tax credit, submit IRS Form 5696 when filing your taxes. Learn more about your eligibility as detailed on IRS.gov.
                            </li>
                            </ol>
                        </p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">How to go Solar?</h2>
                        <p> There is many ways to answer this question. These are just a few of the steps it will take you to go solar. 
                            <ol>Are you a good fit for solar?
                                   <ol>Step 1: Get quotes</ol>
                                    <ol>Step 2: Choose an installer</ol>
                                    <ol> Step 3: Schedule a site visit</ol>
                                    <ol>Step 4: Decide how to pay for your system</ol>
                                    <ol> Step 5: Prepare for your installation</ol>
